#Q3 Write a program which contains filter(), map() and reduce() in it. Python application 
# which contains one list of numbers. List contains  the numbers which are accepted from user.
# Filter should filter our all such numbers which greater than or equal to 70 and less than or equal to 90.
# Map function will increase each number by 10. Reduce will return product of all that numbers.

# Enter the Number of Elements in List: 8
# Input List = [77, 87, 89, 64,32,75,81,79]
# List after filter = [77, 87, 89, 75, 81, 79]
# List after map = [87, 97, 99, 85, 91, 89]
# Output of reduce = 575143884315
