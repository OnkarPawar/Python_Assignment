#Q8. explain what happen to __name__:
#   when python file is executed directly.
#   when the same file is imported as module?
# Ans: __name__ variable acts as how the interpreter enters your file.  
# The interpreter treats this file as the entry point of the program.
# Any code inside an if __name__ == "__main__": block will be executed.#
