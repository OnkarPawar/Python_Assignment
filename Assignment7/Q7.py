#Q7. What is a module in Python? How is it different from a function?
# Ans: In python module is simply file containing Python code- variable, function, classes,  that can reuse in python programs, easier maintance & debuging, avoid duplication and orgnige good code file with .py extension.
# Diff: function is block of code. Module is file containing code function and variable.
#       To avoid repeating logic in a script. To sahre code across different project/files
#       Access function like function_Name(). Accecc import <module_name>
