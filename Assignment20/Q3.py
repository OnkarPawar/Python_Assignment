#Q3 Design a python application that creates two threads named EvenList and OddList.
# 1.Both thread should accept a list of integers as input.
# 2.The EvenList thread should:
#     .Extract all even elements from the list.
#     .Calculate and display thier sum.
# 3.The OddList thread should:
#     .Extract all odd elements from the list.
#     .Calculate and display thier sum.
# 4.Threads should run concurrently.
