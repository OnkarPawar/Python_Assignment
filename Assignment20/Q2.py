#Q2 Design a python application that creates two threads named EvenFactor and OddFactor.
# 1.Both thread should accept one integer number as a parameter.
# 2.The EvenFactor thread should:
#     .Identify all even factors of the given number.
#     .Calculate and display the sum of even factors.
# 3.The OddFactor thread should:
#     .Identify all odd factors of the given number.
#     .Calculate and display the sum of odd factors.
# 4.After both threads complete execution, the main thread should display the message
#     "Exit from main".
