#Q1 Design a python application that creates two sepatrate threds named Even and Odd.
# 1.The Even thread should display the first 10 even numbers.
# 2.The Odd thread should display the first 10 odd numbers.
# 3.Both threads should execute independently using threading module.
# 4.Ensure proper thread creation and execution.
