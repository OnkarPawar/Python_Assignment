#Q5 Design a python application that creates two threads named Thread1 and Thread2.
# 1.Thread1 should display numbers from 1 to 50.
# 2.Thread2 should display numbers from 50 to 1 in reverse order.
# 3.Ensure that:
#     . Thread2 starts execution only after Thread1 has completed.
# 4.Use appropriate thread synchronization.
